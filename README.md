The file README.md is a guide for the MachineLearningStocks project, a Python-based starter project for stock prediction using machine learning.

Project Overview:

Uses pandas and scikit-learn to predict stock movements based on historical fundamentals.

The workflow involves:

Collecting historical stock fundamentals and price data.

Preprocessing the data.

Training an ML model.

Backtesting its performance.

Making predictions using current data.

Features:

Parses stock fundamentals from Yahoo Finance.

Uses pandas-datareader for price data.

Implements a backtesting strategy to evaluate predictions.

Can be extended with feature engineering, different ML models, or alternative data sources.

Quickstart

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies via pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run various scripts (download_historical_prices.py, parsing_keystats.py, backtesting.py, etc.) to process data, train a model, and make predictions.
